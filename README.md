Game Overview:

In "Task Defender" you step into the shoes of a protaganist (you) who has discovered a magical orb. You are made a wizard by the orb. As a wizard, you are tasked with defending yourself from baddies, these baddies are actually representations of your tasks, and your goal is to transform them from stress-inducing burdens into sources of wellness and DOPAMINE.

Utilize your magical powers, strategic planning, and quick reflexes to repel the stress-monster baddies and ensure the safety of your vibe in this unique and addictive tower defense game!

The game's code revolves around the tower defense gameplay mechanics with a twist, where the stress-monster baddies represent the tasks. The Task class defines the individual tasks, including attributes such as name, deadline, and category. Each task becomes a stress-monster baddy that must be dealt with. As they traverse the arena, your towers bombard them with positive spells, gradually transforming them into sources of wellness and happiness.

Baddies that have been successfully converted into sources of wellness and happiness are dynamically removed from the list.

As the game progresses, waves of stress-monster baddies become more challenging, requiring more efficient spellcasting, and task management. Players earn points and rewards for successfully transforming the baddies, enabling them to unlock new towers, upgrade existing ones, and acquire more powerful spells.
